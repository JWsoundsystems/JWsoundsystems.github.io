    <h2>Biography:</h2>

    <p>
      John William Coltrane (September 23, 1926 â€“ July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. 
      He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. 
      He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history. He received many posthumous awards, including canonization by the African Orthodox Church and a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. 
      His second wife was pianist/harpist Alice Coltrane and their son, Ravi Coltrane, is also a saxophonist.
